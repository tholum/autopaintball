autopaintball
=============
Inspired by http://projectsentrygun.rudolphlabs.com/ This project is taking that to the next step, I want to use opencv to acheave the same targeting and color recognition, but with increased performance as well as more platforms being supported, My main target is BeagleBone running ubuntu, And I will use the onboard pins to controll the servo's as well as set some configs,

Hear is my current List of features I am planning on implementing

Shorterm Goals

- [ ] Detect and Target Objects Based on color
- [ ] Detect and Target Movement
- [ ] Exclude Targets based on Color ( 2 colors preset )
- [ ] Configureable Output ( Arduino or GPIO, if GPIO which pin's )
- [ ] Read Config's via GPIO input's
- [ ] 3d Printable turret 

Longterm Goals

- [ ] Remote UI ( Controll Via a network )
- [ ] 360 Radius ( muliple cameras ) and special gearing
- [ ] Network Config ( Switch Teams, Read Current Teams )
- [ ] Muliple Colors
- [ ] "Kill Cam" Record video's of hits

The Biggest feature I plan on having on in this version that they currently is the abbility to switch which team ( Or safe color ) so One gameset people could play is "Capture the turrets" where they can
